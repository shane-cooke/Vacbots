## Note about Target and Non-Target files

I was having massive trouble at the start of this project getting the ASTRA application to
automatically find the vacuumworld `.jar` file, and had to add it manually myself. I thought
it would be best to submit a version of my project with the target folder and a version
without the target folder because of this.
